CORONAVIRUS SPECIAL INFORMATION FOR PHYSICIANS AND RESEARCHERS

Chlorine dioxide (ClO2) has been used for over 100 years to combat all types of bacteria, viruses and fungi successfully.
It acts as a disinfectant, since in its mode of action it turns out to be an oxidant. [1# BiologicalEfficacyList ] 
It is very similar to the way our own body acts, for example in phagocytosis, where an oxidation process is used to eliminate all 
kinds of pathogens.

Chlorine dioxide (ClO2) is a yellowish gas that, to date, has not been introduced into the conventional pharmacopoeia as an active 
ingredient, although it is used on a mandatory basis to disinfect and preserve blood bags for transfusions. [2# Alcide studies on 
blood disinfection] It is also used in most bottled waters suitable for consumption, since it does not leave toxic residues; besides, 
it is a gas that is very soluble in water and evaporates from 11 ºC.

The recent Covid-19 coronavirus pandemic demands urgent solutions with new approaches. Therefore, chlorine dioxide (ClO2) in 
low-dose aqueous solution promises to be an ideal, rapid and effective solution. All too often, the solution is in the simplest of ways.

The approach is as follows: on the one hand we know that viruses are absolutely sensitive to oxidation and on the other hand, 
if it works in human blood bags against viruses such as HIV and other pathogens.

Chlorine dioxide (ClO2) has been used for over 100 years to combat all types of bacteria,
viruses and fungi successfully. It acts as a disinfectant, since in its mode of action it turns out
to be an oxidant. [1# BiologicalEfficacyList ] It is very similar to the way our own body acts,

The recent Covid-19 coronavirus pandemic demands urgent solutions with new approaches. Therefore, chlorine dioxide 
(ClO2) in low-dose aqueous solution promises to be an ideal, rapid and effective solution. All too often, the solution 
is in the simplest of ways. The approach is as follows: on the one hand we know that viruses are absolutely
sensitive to oxidation and on the other hand, if it works in human blood bags against viruses such as HIV and other pathogens, 
why would it not work organically against the coronavirus?

1. Chlorine dioxide removes viruses through the process of selective oxidation in a very
short time. It does this by denaturing the capsid proteins, and then oxidizes the genetic
material of the virus, disabling it.
The application of chlorine dioxide (ClO2) orally or even parenterally is a different approach
that has been studied by Andreas Ludwig Kalcker for more than thirteen years with a result
of three pharmaceutical patents for parenteral use.It can be produced by any pharmacy as
an extemporaneous preparation and has been used in a similar form as (DAC N-055) in the
old German Drug Codex as "Sodium Chlorosum" since 1990.


So far, only vaccine based solutions have been proposed, resulting in extremely slow and
risky processes, as they always require sufficient energy reserves that a body affected with

the disease cannot provide. The great advantage of chlorine dioxide (ClO2) is that it works
for any viral subspecies and there is no possible resistance to this type of oxidation (let's not
forget that this substance has been used for 100 years in waste water without generating
any resistance). [#3 Investigation on virucidal activity of chlorine dioxide] 

2. There is already scientific evidence that chlorine dioxide is effective on coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, a base
virus of COVID-19 [SARS Fact Sheet, National Agricultural Biosecurity Center, Kansas State
University] and the Coronavirus family in general - [Chlorine Dioxide, Part 1 A Versatile,
High-Value Sterilant for the Biopharmaceutical Industry, Barry Wintner, Anthony Contino,
Gary O'Neill. BioProcess International DECEMBER 2005.] It has also been shown to be
effective in human coronavirus [#4 BASF Aseptrol document] and in animals such as dogs,
known as canine respiratory coronavirus, or cats, including the feline enteric coronavirus
(FECV) and the better known feline infectious peritonitis virus (FIPV), since it denatures the
capsules by oxidation inactivating the virus in a short time [2-log 4.2 / 4-log 25.1 Source
USEPA 2003 WHO Guidelines for drinking water Quality].

It should be noted that chlorine dioxide for ingestion is a new antiviral approach because it is
an oxidant and manages to eliminate any subspecies or variations of viruses by
combustion.[6#ClO2 is a size selective biocide] Given the emergency situation in which we
currently find ourselves with Covid-19, the oral use of ClO2 is considered immediately
through a protocol already known and used.

3. Toxicity: The biggest problems with drugs in general are due to their toxicity and side
effects.New studies show its feasibility.[7#New Clo2 safety evaluation 2017] Although the
toxicity of chlorine dioxide is known for mass inhalation, there is not a single clinically proven
death even at high doses from oral ingestion.[8#Controlled Clinical Evaluations of Clo2 in
Man] The LD50 is considered to be 292 mg per kilogram for 14 days, where its equivalent
in a 50 kg adult would be 15,000 mg per two weeks of a gas dissolved in water (something
almost impossible). .[9# toxicity of clo2 and clorite ions] The sub toxic oral doses used are
around 50 mg dissolved in 100 ml of water 10 times a day which is equivalent to 0.5 g per
day. (and therefore only 1/30 of the above LD50 dose of 15 g ClO2 per day).

Chlorine dioxide dissociates, it decomposes in the human body in a few hours into an
insignificant amount of common salt (NaCL) and oxygen(O2) within the human body.
Measurements of venous blood gas have indicated that the affected patient's lung
oxygenation capacity is substantially improved.

WORKING MECHANISM OF CHLORINE DIOXIDE AGAINST VIRUSES

As a rule, most viruses behave similarly and once they bind to the appropriate host type -
bacteria or cell, depending on the case - the nucleic acid component of the virus being
injected takes over after the protein synthesis processes of the infected cell. Certain
segments of the viral nucleic acid are responsible for the replication of the genetic material in
the capsid. In the presence of these nucleic acids, the CLO2 molecule becomes unstable
and dissociates, releasing the resulting oxygen into the environment, which in turn helps to
oxygenate the surrounding tissue by increasing mitochondrial activity and thus the immune
system response.[6#ClO2 is a size selective biocide]

The nucleic acids, DNA-RNA, consist of a chain of puric and pyrimidine bases, see: guanine
(G), cytosine (C), adenine (A) and thymine (T). It is the sequence of these four units along
the chain that makes one segment different from another. The guanine base, which is found
in both RNA and DNA, is very sensitive to oxidation, forming 8-oxoguanine as a byproduct of
it. Therefore, when the CLO2 molecule comes into contact with guanine and oxidizes it and
leads to the formation of 8-oxoguanine, thus blocking the replication of the viral nucleic acid
by base pairing. Although replication of the protein capsid can continue; the formation of the
fully functional virus is blocked by oxidation thanks to CLO2.

The CLO2 molecule presents characteristics that make it an ideal candidate for treatment in
the clinical setting, as it is a product with a high power of selective oxidation and a great
capacity to reduce acidosis, increasing oxygen in tissues and mitochondria, thus facilitating
the rapid recovery of patients with lung diseases as shown in the data above..

POSSIBLE PRECAUTIONS AND CONTRAINDICATIONS

Chlorine dioxide reacts with antioxidants and various acids, so the use of vitamin C or
ascorbic acid during treatment is not recommended, as it cancels out the effectiveness of
chlorine dioxide in eliminating pathogens (the antioxidant effect of one prevents the selective
oxidation of the other). Therefore, it is not recommended to take antioxidants during the days
of treatment.
It has been shown that stomach acid does not affect their effectiveness. In the cases of
patients with Warfarin treatment, they should constantly check the values to avoid cases of
overdose, since it has been proven that chlorine dioxide improves blood flow.

Although chlorine dioxide is very soluble in water, it has the advantage that it does not
hydrolyze, so it does not generate toxic carcinogenic THMs (trihalomethanes) like chlorine. It
also does not cause genetic mutations or malformations.
A protocol has been developed whereby a solution of this compound can be taken orally and
intravenously.

WORLD MEDICAL ASSOCIATION DECLARATION OF HELSINKI

Excerpt:
Ethical Principles for Medical Research Involving Human Subjects
Adopted by the 18th WMA General Assembly, Helsinki, Finland, June 1964, and amended
by the Committee
64th WMA General Assembly, Fortaleza, Brazil, October 2013

General principles
3. The Declaration of Geneva of the World Medical Association binds the physician to the
formula "to look after the health of my patient first and foremost", and the International Code
of Medical Ethics states that: "A physician shall consider the best interests of the patient in
providing medical care.
4. It is the duty of physicians to promote and safeguard the health, well-being and rights of
patients, including those involved in medical research. A physician's knowledge and
conscience should be subordinate to the fulfillment of that duty.
5. Progress in medicine is based on research that must ultimately include studies in human
beings.


Unproven interventions in clinical practice

37. When proven interventions do not exist in the care of a patient or other known
interventions have proven ineffective, the physician, after seeking expert advice, with the
informed consent of the patient or a legally authorized representative, may be permitted to
use unproven interventions if, in his or her judgment, this gives some hope of saving life,
restoring health or alleviating suffering. Such interventions should be subsequently
investigated to assess their safety and efficacy. In all cases, such new information should be
recorded and, where appropriate, made available to the public.
