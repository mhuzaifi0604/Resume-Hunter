Subjects manifested no physical abnor- malities at the pretreatment examination, were 21 to 35 years of age, and weighed within Â± 10% of normal body weight for their frame and stature. A history of disease or any medical or surgical condi- tion which might interfere with the absorption, excretion, or metabolism of substances by the body precluded inclusion. Regular drug intake prior to the start of the investigation, either therapeutic or recreational, resulted in exclusion from the study. Normal methemoglobin levels, thyroid function, and glutathione levels were mandatory. Written informed consent was obtained from each subject prior to initiation of treatment. For Phase III, volunteers were defined as glucose- 6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G-6-PD)-deficient on the basis ofa hemoglobin G-6-PD level of less than 5.0 IU/GM hemoglobin in the pre-study screening. Phase III subjectswerenormal in all other respects. 
Water Disinfectant Preparation A detailed description of the water disinfectant preparation techniques has been presented by Lub- bers and Bianchine (1). In general, freshly pre- pared stock solutions of chlorine dioxide, sodium chlorite, sodium chlorate, chlorine and chloramine were assayed by the colorimetric techniques of Palin (2) then diluted with organic-free demineral- ized deionized water to appropriate concentrations. Individual bottles were capped and stored in the dark under refrigeration until use. All bottles were coded by an independent observer and the identity of each bottle remained "double-blind" to both the investigative staff and the volunteer subjects. 
Study Design: Phase I The 60 volunteers in Phase I were divided at random into six treatment groups (1). Ten persons were assigned to receive each of the disinfectants; the ten members of the control group received untreated water. The study involved a series of six sequences of three days each. Treatment concen- trations were increased for each treatment. The specific concentrations or disinfectant administered to the study participants are listed in Table 1. A clinical evaluation of the collection of blood and urine samples for determination of pretreatment baseline laboratory values preceded the first treat- ment. On the first day of each three day treatment sequence, each volunteer ingested 1000 ml of the water in two portions. The second 500 ml portion aliquot was administered 4 hr after the first. Each 500 ml portion was consumed within 15 min. Only two doses of disinfectant were administered on the 
LUBBERS, CHAUAN AND BIANCHINE first day of each treatment sequence. No disinfec- tant was administered on the second and third day of each sequence, since these two days were to serve as followup observation days. The second day of the treatment sequence consisted of a physical examination and collection of blood and urine sam- ples for determination of posttreatment laboratory values. On the third day, each volunteer was given aphysical examination to determine residual effects of treatment with the water disinfectants and byproducts. Taste evaluations were obtained at each dose level. Study participants were asked to rate the treated water as very unpleasant, slightly unpleas- ant, not pleasant, pleasant, or tasteless. 
Study Design: Phase II The sixty volunteers of Phase II were divided at random into six treatment groups of ten subjects each (3). In order to assure efficient management of the 60 subjects, they were randomly assigned to three subsets. These subsets were sequentially entered into the study on three successive days and exited from this study in a similar fashion. For all of the treatment groups, the concentration of disin- fectants ingested was 5 mg/l. The control group received untreated water. Each subject received 500 ml daily for 12 weeks. Physicals, collection of blood and urine samples for laboratory assays, and taste evaluations were conducted on a weekly basis during the treatment period and for8 weeks follow- ing cessation of treatment. 
Study Design: Phase III The three glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase- deficient subjects of Phase III were given sodium chlorite at a concentration of 5 mg/I. chlorite (4). The treatment protocol was identical to that of Phase II, with daily administration of 500 ml of solution to each volunteer. 
Evaluation Procedures An extensive battery of parameters was moni- tored to assess the biochemical and physiological response to the oral ingestion of the water disinfec- tants and water treatment by-products (Table 2). All laboratory determninations of biochemical param- eters were conducted by a licensed medical labora- tory, Consolidated Biomedical Laboratories, Inc. (CBL), Columbus, Ohio, HEW license number 34-1030. For each volunteer, pretreatment baseline values and six sets of posttreatment values were compiled. Laboratory tests were carefully chosen.

60inspection of each of these medical files presented a review of the general clinical health of each subject. The careful clinical evaluation of every subject in Phases , II and III failed to reveal any clinically important impact upon the medical well-being of any subject as a result of disinfectant ingestion. Further, there was no apparent grouping of the minor subjective symptoms and objective signs noted throughout the study; the "colds," "lymphadeno- pathy," "sore throats" and "flu" problems noted episodically appear to be randomly dispersed among the treatment groups. All subjects remained negative with respect to the Coombs tests and the sickle cell tests during the investigation. Hemoglobin electro- phoresis results indicated that, in Phase II, a small number of subjects yielded abnormal hemoglobin distributions but these individuals were found to be randomly distributed in both the treatment groups and in the control group. Examination of electro- cardiograms revealed no abnormalities. Vital signs (blood pressure, pulse rate, respira- tion rate and body temperature) were measured on a regular basis to provide immediate feedback to the monitoring physician on the acute physiological response of study participants to treatment. The statistical analysis of the vital signs was limited to the calculation of arithmetic group means and stan- dard deviations from the mean. The compiled vital signs were examined for evidence of consistent response to treatment. No such evidence was found. The subjective evaluations of palatability indi- cated that few subjects found the test substances to have an objectionable taste at levels up to 24 mg/l. 
Quantitative Forthe Phase I acute rising-dose tolerance study, a two-way analysis of variance with repeated mea- sures was used to compare the treatment group values of each biochemical parameter to the corres- ponding values of the control group. The analysis of variance allowed distinctions to be made among the possible sources of variation. Differences between two groups that existed prior to treatment, parallel variations in quantitative chemical values due to laboratory drift and authentic treatment-related changes in physiological parameters could be dis- tinguished. Three probabilities were calculated for each case: the group main effect (G), the time main effect (R), and group-time interaction (RG). The treatment groups and the corresponding biochemi- cal parameters for which a strong probability of treatment-related change was computed (that is, RG - 0.05) are listed in the first column of Table 3. To assist in determining the clinical importance of the statistically significant group time interac- tions, the group, mean and standard deviations 
LUBBERS, CHAUAN AND BIANCHINE from the mean were examined for the pretreatment baseline assay and each posttreatment assay for each of the treatment groups. In all instances, the group mean values remain well within the estab- lished normal ranges. On the basis of the small magnitude of change within the normal range and the duration of the study, it was concluded that the trends identified by the analysis of variance are unlikely to be of clinical importance. The possibility that the trends might become clinically important with increased exposure cannot be excluded. Alternative statistical techniques were employed for Phase II. An omnibus testing technique was used initially. Totestthe hypothesis that the response ofone or more of the groups was different to that of the rest of the groups, an analysis of variance with repeated measures was performed in which values for all six treatment groups were included. For the parameters urea nitrogen and mean corpuscular hemoglobin, RG-values < 0.05 were obtained. Sup- plementary tests were performed. Analyses of vari- ance with repeated measures in which the values of each treatment group were compared to the cor- responding values of the control group were cho- sen. The use of the analysis of variance in this manner is flawed by the common control group. However, the results of the analyses may be used with caution. The analysis of variance yielded sta- tistically significant RG-values in the comparison of the group mean corpuscul ar hemoglobin values for the chlorite and the chlorate groups and of the group mean urea nitrogen values of chlorate and chlorine dioxide treatment groups to the corres- ponding control group values, as shown in Table 3. No linear trends were detected by linear regres- sion analysis of the chlorite group's mean corpus- cular hemoglobin values, the chlorate group's urea nitrogen levels or the chlorite group's ureanitrogen values. Mean corpuscular hemoglobin levels in the chlo- rate group yielded a probability of 0.01 upon linear regression analysis. The relative slope associated with thechange duringthe 12-weektreatmentperiod was approximately 1% of the normal physiological range per week. We believe that no physiological importance may be attributed with confidence to the variation. However, it is impossible on the basis of this study to rule out the potential physiological significance of the trend. Further study is warrant- ed.The small number ofsubjects (three) in Phase III negated the value of many statistical procedures. Linear regression analyses were chosen. The third column of Table 3 lists the biochemical parameters for which a high probability of change with respect to time was calculated. The p-values computed by
