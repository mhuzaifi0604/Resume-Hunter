Introduction 
The emergence and dissemination of new antibiotic-resistant bacterial strains caused by an overuse of antibiotics [1] is a global public-health concern. Methicillin Resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) [1,2] and Carbapenem- or Extreme Drug-Resistant Acinetobacter baumannii [3,4] are only two well known examples for such bacteria attracting world wide attention. Moreover, while the number of antibiotic resistant infections is on the rise, the number of new antibiotics is declining [1,2]. As a result of such a dangerous situation, searches for new antimicrobial agents, as well as strategies including a switch from antibiotic to antiseptic therapies, whenever that is feasible, have been initiated. 
When treating local infections of wounds, ulcers or an infected mucous membrane, the application of antiseptics instead of antibiotics is a reasonable alternative especially because bacteria are less able to develop resistance against them [5]. Presently the majority of the antiseptics used for wounds [6] are organic compounds. The most frequently applied ones [6] are chlorhexidine (chlorhexidine digluconate), octenidine (octanidine dihydrochloride), polyhexanide (polyhexametylene biguanide) and triclosan (5-chlorine-2-(2,4- dichlorphenoxy)-phenol). Notable exceptions are PVP-iodine (poly(vinylpirrolidone)-iodine complex) [6] where the active ingredient is iodine, and silver [7], both being inorganic compounds.

In spite of that, as far as we know, ClO2 solutions are not frequently used as antiseptic. This is because the available ClO2 solutions were more or less contaminated with other chemicals applied in its synthesis and that contamination formed a major obstacle in medical applications like treating infected wounds, for example.

conditions: c(0,t)=c0 and c(d,t)=0, respectively. There is no ClO2 in the membrane at the start of the experiment, so the initial condition: c(0<x≤d,0)=0 (see Figure S1 in Information S1).While the lower face of the protein membrane is not in direct contact with the liquid phase, such direct contact would not make any difference regarding the ClO2 transport. This is because the chemical potential of ClO2 in the liquid and the vapour phase is the same due to the equilibrium between the liquid and the vapour phase established by continuous stirring. 
Above the protein membrane there is a silicone rubber membrane in order to block the transport of any other chemicals except ClO2. Silicone rubber is highly permeable for chlorine dioxide, but it is practically impermeable for other reagents [13]. This way the ClO2 transport across the test membrane can be measured selectively. 
Both protein membranes had a thickness of 0.5 mm and a diameter of 10 cm. The diameter of the active area in the apparatus was 6 cm resulting in an active area of 28 cm2. The volume of the aqueous ClO2 solution was 40 ml and its ClO2 concentration was around 1000 ppm. (The exact value is given at each experiment.) 
After crossing the membranes, ClO2 enters the upper aqueous solution which is made by mixing 10 ml of water, 2 ml 
ClO2 Is a Size-Selective Antimicrobial Agent 
of 1 M sulphuric acid, 1 ml of 1 M KI, and 0.5 ml of 0.01 M Na2S2O3 and as an indicator, two drops of 5 % starch solution is also added. When ClO2 enters the upper solution, it oxidizes iodide to iodine, which, in turn, is reduced back to iodide again by Na2S2O3 as long as thiosulphate is in excess. However, when all thiosulphate is consumed, the intense blue-black colour of the starch-triiodide complex appears suddenly. The time t when the whole solution becomes homogeneously black (the time of the „black burst”) was recorded and another 0.5 ml of Na2S2O3 solution was added with the help of the syringe shown in the Figure. Addition of the thiosulphate eliminated the blue-black colour immediately but, after a certain period, when enough new ClO2 was transported across the membrane, it reappeared again. Then the cycle was repeated starting with the injection of a new 0.5 ml portion of the Na2S2O3 solution. The results of the measurements were depicted in a V=V(t) diagram where t is the time of the n-th dark burst and V = n×0.5 ml that is the total volume of the thiosulphate solution added before the n-th breakthrough. 
The experiments were performed at laboratory temperature 24 ± 2 °C. 
Preparation of the gelatin membrane 
To prepare a mechanically strong membrane, it was reinforced by filter paper and the gelatin was cross-linked with

glutaraldehyde. As the cellulose in the filter paper does not react with ClO2 from the point of our experiments, it is an inert material. 
10 ml of 10 % aqueous gelatin solution was mixed rapidly with 0.5 ml of 25 % glutaraldehyde solution at room temperature, and a filter paper disk (diameter: 10 cm) was soaked with the mixture. Then the disk was placed between doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0079157.g001 
two glass plates covered with polyethylene foils. Spacers were applied to produce a 0.5 mm thick membrane. After a 2 hour setting time the filter paper reinforced gelatin membrane was removed from the form and it was placed into distilled water overnight before the measurements. 
Preparation of the pig bladder membrane 
For the experiments, membrane disks with 10 cm diameters were cut from commercially available pig bladders and they were kept in distilled water for one day at +4 °C to stabilize their water content. The pig bladder membranes are slightly asymmetric: the surface of one side is smoother than the other. To obtain reproducible results, the membrane was always fixed in the apparatus with its smoother side facing downwards. 
Results 
Our results cover the following themes: First, we present and evaluate membrane transport experiments aiming to determine 
i) the diffusion coefficient of ClO2 D in a reactive protein medium, and 
ii) the concentration of reactive groups s0 in that medium. 
To evaluate the membrane transport experiments we applied a reaction-diffusion model for the transport of ClO2 in a medium containing reactive proteins. The details of that theory and the

can be observed. In the first regime, the amount of the permeated ClO2 is very small, then, after a rapid transition period the cumulated amount of ClO2 increases linearly with time. Real dynamics can be approximated with the following simplified model: zero permeation is assumed at the beginning during a waiting period but right after that a constant diffusion current appears, thus, the permeated amount increases linearly with time. To characterize such a dynamic behaviour the concept of „time lag” can be introduced: it is the time where the asymptote of the linear regime crosses the time axis [21]. 
Regarding the asymptotes of the corresponding curves, the time lag in the first and in the second experiment is TL1 = 627 s and TL2 = 175 s, respectively. A logical explanation for this difference is that some ClO2 is consumed inside the gelatin in

All the three measurements (indicated as 1st day, 2nd day and 3rd day) were performed with the same pig bladder membrane but on three successive days. The membrane was kept in distilled water at +4 °C overnight between the experiments which were always started with fresh solutions. 
To check the reproducibility of our measurements, we repeated the measurements with another pig bladder membrane (not shown in the Figure). While the new membrane was from a different pig bladder and its blood vessel pattern was also different, the relative deviation between the results of the two series of experiments was surprisingly small: only about 10 %. (The blood vessel structure of the membrane becomes visible as a dark network before a „black burst” because the permeability of the membrane is somewhat higher

through those vessels.) 
Another interesting observation was that the pig bladder membrane maintained its integrity and its mechanical strength even after the third experiment. This is because ClO2 reacts selectively with certain amino acid residues of the proteins but does not destroy the peptide bonds thus the primary protein structure can survive. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0079157.g003

Calculating the ClO2 diffusion coefficient and the effective concentration of ClO2 consuming substrates in pig bladder the actual ClO2 consumption by the reactions within the membrane delaying the breakthrough. If we assume that the rate of the chemical reaction is limited by the diffusional transport of ClO2 across a zone already without reactive amino acids toward a zone of unreacted ones, then a sharp reaction front will develop on the boundary of the two zones (see Figure 
Evaluation of the results was made in a similar way as in the case of the gelatin membrane. It was assumed that the time lag measured in the third experiment TL3 =226 s is a purely diffusional time lag that is TL3 ≈ TDM. The diffusion coefficient of ClO2 in a pig bladder membrane calculated from the above assumption is D = 1.84×10-6 cm2s-1. That value is in good S1 in Information S1). The front starting from one side of the 
agreement with the D = 1.80×10-6 cm2s-1 value calculated from membrane and driven by diffusion, propagates slowly through the membrane and TRM is the time when it arrives to the other side of the membrane. According to a detailed derivation in the 
the steady state current J3 = 14.1 nmol/s of the 3rd experiment. As we can see, the diffusion coefficient of ClO2 in a pig bladder tissue is only 30 % smaller than in the unstructured Information S1, TRM can be given by the so-called parabolic 
gelatin. This supports our assumption that the cellular structure rate law (see equation (S12) in Information S1): 
of the pig bladder tissue does not matter too much from the TRM= 12 ⋅ cs00 point of the diffusional transport of ClO2 as it can penetrate through the external and internal lipid membranes of the individual cells of the tissue. 
However, there is a more significant deviation between the pig bladder and the gelatin regarding s0, the effective substrate concentration. Assuming that the time lag in the first experiment TL1 = 2770 s is due to the chemical reaction, TL1 ≈ TRM, then from (3) we get s0 = 56 mM, indicating that the concentration of the reactive components in the pig bladder tissue is about two times higher than that is in the gelatin. This is a reasonable result as the animal tissue is denser, and it contains not only methionine and tyrosine like gelatin, but also cysteine and tryptophan residues. 
We would like to add that in a series of measurements performed with the same membrane the steady state ClO2 current in the first experiment is always smaller than in the subsequent ones, although the ClO2 source is not changed. This effect is more pronounced in the case of an animal membrane (compare the slope of the 1st day experiment with that of the other days). The phenomenon can be understood if we assume that some components, which are able to react 
PLOS ONE | www.plosone.org 5 November 2013 | Volume 8 | Issue 11 | e79157 
⋅ dD 2(3) 
where s0 is the initial effective substrate concentration, i.e. the ClO2 consuming capacity of the membrane in unit volume, and c0 is ClO2 concentration at the boundary of the membrane. 
Substituting the more reliable diffusion coefficient measured in the steady-state of the second experiment D = 2.6×10-6 cm2s-1 and applying the assumption that TRM = TL1 = 627 s, the effective substrate concentration of the gelatin membrane s0 can be calculated. The result: s0 = 26.2 mM. 
Permeation of ClO2 through a pig bladder membrane 
In this experiment, we studied the ClO2 permeability of a pig bladder membrane which is a relatively thin (in our case it was 0.5 mm thick) but sturdy animal tissue. The same apparatus was applied as in the case of the gelatin membrane and the experimental points were depicted in Figure 3 also with the same method. (Titrant volumes and the time of addition are given in Table S2 in Information S1.)

Estimating the killing time for bacteria with cylindrical 
As we can see, the killing time for a bacterium is only a few and spherical geometries 
ms due to its small size. Even if s0, the effective substrate We assume that a bacterium is killed when its whole volume is flooded by ClO2. To calculate the killing time, if we know the shape and the size of the bacterium, we would need two more parameters, the diffusion coefficient of ClO2 D and the effective concentration of ClO2 consuming substrates s0 in the bacterial medium. In the absence of bacterial data it will be assumed that the parameters D and s0 in the single cell of a bacterium are close to that what we have measured above in the animal cell aggregates of the pig bladder. A further simplifying assumption is that only spherical and cylindrical bacteria are considered. Numerical results are calculated for a diameter of 1 μm, which is a characteristic length-scale for bacteria. Mathematical formulas for the killing time and the penetration depth are derived in the Information S1. In this section only the results of those derivations will be given together with some qualitative explanations on their meaning. 
It will be assumed that the rate of the “ClO2 – bacterium reaction” is also limited by the diffusion of ClO2 to the fast reacting amino acid residues fixed in protein molecules like in the case of the much larger membranes and this way a sharp reaction front propagates from the cell wall toward the centre of the bacterium. 
concentration of a bacterium would be an order of magnitude higher than we assumed, the killing time would be still less than 0.1 s. Other approximations applied in our calculations can only overestimate the real killing time. For example, the diffusion coefficient of ClO2 in the pig bladder was measured at 24 ± 2 °C. If ClO2 is used to disinfect a living human tissue, the temperature is higher, which means a larger diffusion coefficient and an even shorter killing time. Another approximation is the concept of fixed substrates. Inside a bacterium mobile substrates like glutathione [25], free amino acids and various antioxidants also occur. These small molecules can diffuse by and large freely within the bacterium. Nevertheless TKILL would still work as a good upper estimate because the mobility of the substrate can only shorten the time needed for ClO2 to reach these substrates and react with them. Furthermore, when the killing time TKILL is regarded as the time when the sharp front reaches the center of the sphere or the symmetry axis of the cylindrical bacterium, it will surely be overestimated, as it is not necessary to oxidize all the available substrate content of a bacterium to kill it. For example, it is enough to oxidize less than 40 % of the methionine content of E. coli to achieve a 100 % kill [26]. 
Intuitively, the killing time TKILL should be analogous to the time lag TRM in a membrane caused by a chemical reaction, because these are the times needed to flood the whole volume. 
Contact time and penetration depth of ClO2 into human skin or wound We can expect, however, that the geometric factor should be

Thus, to give an upper limit for the penetration depth into the human tissue, we will assume that the initial ClO2 concentration (c0 = 4.45 mM, Solumium Oral®) is maintained for 60 s, that is TCON = 60 s, where TCON denotes the contact time. As a zero-th estimate, we assume again that the human tissue has the same D and s0 values like that of the pig bladder tissue. 
Applying the parabolic rate law (see equation (S13) in Information S1 where t = TCON) the penetration depth p can be estimated:

We can see that (4) and (5) are analogous to (3) but the geometric factors for a cylinder and for a sphere are much smaller than for the planar membrane indicating that in these geometries the surface from where diffusion current is starting is relatively larger compared to the volume that has to be flooded.

In free aqueous solutions, the strongest chemical disinfectant is ozone. In biofilms, however, the performance of ozone is rather poor. In addition, ozone is toxic and decomposes in Therapeutic window 
The above formulas and calculations indicate that disinfection of living tissues with aqueous ClO2 solutions has a very wide therapeutic window: while surprisingly low concentrations and short contact times are able to kill bacteria, much higher concentrations and residence times are still safe to use. 
There is one notable exception: inhaling high concentration ClO2 gases for an extended time can be dangerous for human health because the alveolar membrane is extremely thin (a mere 1-2 microns and in some places even below 1 micron). The effect of ClO2 in these membranes is somewhat counterbalanced, however, by the intense blood circulation there. 
aqueous solutions rapidly. (Its half life is only 15 min at 25 °C at pH 7.) All of these disadvantageous properties of ozone prevent its use as an antiseptic in most applications. 
The second strongest disinfectant after ozone is chlorine dioxide. Tanner [30] made a comparative testing of eleven disinfectants on three test organisms (including two bacteria: Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa and one yeast: Saccharomyces cerevisiae). He found that the disinfectant containing ClO2 had the highest biocidal activity on a mg/l basis against the test organisms. Beside antibacterial and antifungal properties, ClO2 also shows strong antiviral activity, about ten times higher than that of sodium hypochlorite [31]. And it inactivates practically all microbes including algae and animal planktons [32] and protozoans [33]. 
Moreover ClO2 can remove biofilms swiftly [12] because it is Discussion

between the reversible HOI-GSH and the ClO2-GSH reactions raises the question whether an analogous revitalization might Comparison of ClO2 and HOCl as possible antiseptic agents 
be also possible in the case of ClO2. This question is all the more justified since in some animal experiments [16] rats were 
HOCl, like ClO2, reacts rapidly with the sulphur containing amino acid residues of methionine and cysteine, the second order rate constant (at pH 7.4 and 22 °C) being 3.8×107 M-1s-1 and 3.0×107 M-1s-1, respectively, and also reacts with tryptophan (1.1×104 M-1s-1) and tyrosine (44 M-1s-1) [40]. However, unlike ClO2, HOCl reacts rapidly with many other amino acid residues and even with peptide bonds [40], and many other compounds such as carbohydrates, lipids, nucleobases, and amines [41]. 
As we can see the important similarity is the fast reaction of both HOCl and ClO2 with the SH group of cysteine. This is important because it is assumed that abolition of ATP synthesis and killing bacteria by HOCl is due to its reaction with sulfhydryl groups [18]. It is a logical assumption that ClO2 can also stop the ATP synthesis as it reacts with the very same SH groups like HOCl. 
At the same time, however, there are important dissimilarities between HOCl and ClO2: 
drinking water containing 200 ppm ClO2 for 90 days but without developing any gastrointestinal problems. In those experiments all ClO2 must have reacted with the animal tissues as it cannot evaporate from the stomach of the rats. To interpret that result it is reasonable to assume that SH groups transported by the circulation system of the rodent protected the epithelial cells in its gastrointestinal tract from an irreversible oxidation by ClO2. 
Above a certain limit, however, when a too high percentage of the protective SH groups is already oxidized, ClO2 would inflict irreversible changes to the higher order protein structures by oxidizing the tyrosine and tryptophan residues [48]. That would certainly happen with the bacteria on the surface of an infected tissue as their GSH supply [26] can be rapidly exhausted by ClO2. Mammalian cells below the surface, however, might survive being supported by the circulation which transports protective sulfhydryl and other reductive compounds to the cells, continuously repairing or even revitalizing them. 
Thus beside their size there is another important difference i) HOCl is much less specific and reacts rapidly with
